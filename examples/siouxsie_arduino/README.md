This will create a little program that will show an animated splash-screen on a 128x64 OLED, on a pi, in C. It uses [Adafruit_SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306).

Install the Adafruit_SSD1306 lib with the Arduino IDE Library Manager, and open the ino file.

I haven't really tested this, but the basic idea should work ok. Let me know if you get it wokring!
