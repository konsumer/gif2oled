This will create a little program that will show an animated splash-screen on a 128x64 OLED, on a pi, in C. It uses [Adafruit_SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306).

Install the Adafruit_SSD1306 lib with the Arduino IDE Library Manager, and open the ino file.

This was tested on an Arduino UNO, but should work on any of [these](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility).

Here is how I hooked it up:
