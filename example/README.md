This will create a little program that will show a weird splash-screen on a 128x64 OLED.

Here is how to use it on the pi:

```
# install C compiler
sudo apt install -y build-essentials

# compile the code!
make
```

I am using [SSD1306_OLED_RPI](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/SSD1306_OLED_RPI). It can do a bunch of cool stuff with this OLED, so go check it out.
